A lightweight macOS menubar app that displays your Claude Code usage limits at a glance — and alerts you when a Claude Code session needs your attention.

## Features

### Usage tracking
- 📊 **Session, Weekly & per-model limits** - including model-scoped weekly caps (e.g. Fable/Opus) as Anthropic rolls them out
- 💵 **Overage tracking** - extra-usage spend against your monthly limit
- 🚦 **Color-coded status** - Green (OK), Yellow (>70%), Red (>90%)
- ⏱️ **Time until reset** for each limit
- 🔄 **Auto-refresh** every 5 minutes, with retry on network/keychain hiccups and refresh on wake from sleep

### Session alerts (opt-in)
- 🔔 **Menu bar bell** with a count when Claude Code sessions are waiting for your permission or input
- 💬 **macOS notifications** when a session needs you - with an on/off toggle, permission status, and a test button
- 📋 **Live session list** in the popover: needs you 🔔 / working ⚙️ / finished ✅
- 🖱️ **Click-to-focus** - click a session (or its notification) to jump to the exact Terminal/iTerm2 tab it's running in; alerts clear once you've visited the session

### Claude status alerts
- 🌡️ **Outage notifications** - get notified when [status.claude.com](https://status.claude.com) reports a problem, and again when service recovers (checked every 5 minutes; toggle in settings)
- 🟢 **Status line in the popover** with a severity dot, linking to the status page

### Claude Code settings editor
- 📝 **Edit your global CLAUDE.md** - tell Claude Code how you like to work, from the app
- 🗓️ **Conversation retention** - set how long Claude Code keeps local transcripts (`cleanupPeriodDays`), preserving all your other settings

### General
- ⬆️ **One-click in-app updates** - when a new version ships, click "Update & Relaunch" in the popover; the update's code signature is verified before installing
- 🚀 **Launch at Login** toggle
- 🪶 **Lightweight** - Native Swift, minimal resources, no frameworks

## Installation

### Download

1. Go to [Releases](../../releases)
2. Download `ClaudeUsage.zip`
3. Unzip and drag `ClaudeUsage.app` to your Applications folder
4. Open the app (you may need to right-click → Open the first time)

### Build from Source

#### Option 1: Xcode GUI
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/claude-usage.git
cd claude-usage
open ClaudeUsage.xcodeproj
```
Then build with ⌘B and run with ⌘R.

#### Option 2: Command Line (macOS 26 / no dev cert)

If you don't have a Mac Development signing certificate, build with ad-hoc signing:

```bash
xcodebuild \
  -project ClaudeUsage.xcodeproj \
  -scheme ClaudeUsage \
  -configuration Debug \
  CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="-" \
  CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO \
  CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO \
  build
```

Then launch the built app:
```bash
open ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/ClaudeUsage-*/Build/Products/Debug/ClaudeUsage.app
```

#### Troubleshooting xcodebuild

If you see `xcodebuild failed to load a required plug-in`, run this once to fix it:
```bash
xcodebuild -runFirstLaunch
```

This is common after a macOS update or fresh Xcode install.

## Requirements

- macOS 13.0 (Ventura) or later
- Claude Code CLI installed and logged in

## Setup

1. Install [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
   ```

2. Log in to Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude
   ```
   
3. Launch Claude Usage - it will read your credentials from Keychain automatically

### Enabling session alerts (optional)

1. Click the menu bar icon → gear icon → toggle **Alert when a session needs attention**
2. This installs a small status hook into `~/.claude/settings.json` (pure POSIX sh, no dependencies; your existing settings and hooks are preserved, and toggling off removes it cleanly)
3. Allow **notifications** when prompted, and allow **"ClaudeUsage wants to control Terminal"** on your first click-to-focus - that's what jumps you to the right terminal tab
4. Hooks take effect for Claude Code sessions started (or resumed) after enabling

**Tip:** if you use macOS Focus modes, add ClaudeUsage to your Focus allowed apps or banners will be silenced.

## How It Works

Claude Usage reads your Claude Code OAuth credentials from macOS Keychain and queries the usage API endpoint at `api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage`.

Session alerts work via Claude Code's hooks system: a tiny shell script reports each session's status (working / needs attention / finished) to JSON sidecar files in `~/.claude/claudeusage/`, which the app watches. Everything stays on your machine.

**Note:** This uses an undocumented API that could change at any time. The app will gracefully handle API changes but may stop working if Anthropic modifies the endpoint.

## Privacy

- Your credentials never leave your machine
- No analytics or telemetry
- No data sent anywhere except Anthropic's API
- Open source - verify the code yourself

## Status Colours

| Normal | Warning | Critical |
|--------|---------|----------|
| 🟢 30% | 🟡 75% | 🔴 95% |

## Troubleshooting

### "Not logged in to Claude Code"

Run `claude` in Terminal and complete the login flow.

### App doesn't appear in menubar

Check if the app is running in Activity Monitor. Try quitting and reopening.

### Usage shows wrong values

Click the refresh button (↻) in the dropdown. If still wrong, your Claude Code session may have expired - run `claude` again.
